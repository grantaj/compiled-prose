Constraints:
- Do not edit the section file.
- Identify issues with the thread of the argument.
- Identify any problems with the level of writing, coherence, and structure.
- Identify issues in clarity, flow, rigor, structure, and citation placement.
- Highlight any claims that are weakly supported or overly dense.
- Provide actionable suggestions.
- Flag overly dense paragraphs or sentences.
- Flag overlong lead-ins, citation clustering, and missing bridges between paragraphs.
- Flag awkward text, repetitions, and omissions.
- Flag uncited analytical claims that appear non-obvious.
- Flag irrelevant or weak citations which do not support the argument.
- Flag any sentence where justification/legitimacy is asserted without a direct legitimacy source.
- Identify missing references that could reasonably be expected in a text like this.

Formatting:
- Output Markdown only. Do not output LaTeX.
- Ignore any global instruction that says to output LaTeX; this stage is a review report.

Output:
- Save a concise review report file with numbered comments.
- End the report with one line: "REVIEW AGAIN: YES" or "REVIEW AGAIN: NO". Only specify YES if you identified serious problems in your review.

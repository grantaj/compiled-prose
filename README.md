# compiled-prose
This essay concerns academic and technical writing: forms of prose whose primary function is the reliable transmission of concepts, arguments, and procedures. In these contexts, clarity is primal. Expressive gesture is not merely optional but often counterproductive—at best introducing noise, and at worst functioning as borrowed weight, rhetorical camouflage, or obfuscation. The essay proposes compiled prose as a model in which conceptual structure is authored explicitly and upstream, while natural language is treated as a compiled artefact rather than a site of primary expression. In this model, the detailed outline functions as source code, encoding the logic, dependencies, and invariants of the argument; prose becomes machine code, a deterministic rendering optimised for legibility and compatibility with disciplinary norms, institutional conventions, and reader expectations. This is not a claim that prose is unimportant, nor that meaning is fully reducible to structure, nor that expressive writing is obsolete. It is a claim about separation of concerns: in domains where misunderstanding carries real epistemic or material cost, treating style, voice, and register as externalised constraints—akin to compilation targets or stylesheets—improves reproducibility, auditability, and revision without erasing conceptual authorship. The essay is descriptive rather than prescriptive. It names a practice already emerging, often implicitly and unevenly, under the pressures of scale, collaboration, and AI-assisted execution, and asks what follows if we acknowledge it explicitly rather than continuing to treat linguistic execution as a sacred site of authorship.
